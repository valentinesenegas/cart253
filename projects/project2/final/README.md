# Just PresiDance

By Valentine Sénégas
As part of the course Creative Computation I

The public figure who inspired this creation is Donald Trump. As a very iconic person that likes to be the star and to make impressions, the meme potential is very strong. At some of his rallies, he showed off his dance skills, and his performance did not go unnoticed — it actually went viral. I decided to take advantage of this situation to create something fun.

With this project, I wanted to expand the meme surrounding Donald Trump even further, and create a new universe where a president is a star of the dance scene.

One of the videos that inspired me for this project was this compilation of Trump dancing at several rallies [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zph7YXfjMhg]. The dance moves in the game are based on real moves that Donald Trump performs. I also included a special dance move Trump related to the accordion meme. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhDz8xMXU8s].

I believe that I accomplished my goal of creating a fun experience, especially for people who are already interested in memes and who have an overall understanding of American culture. The songs that I chose were intentionally very different from each other, but all of them still related to a stereotypical idea that many have of the United States. For example, the song YMCA is the song on which Trump danced at the end of his rallies. I adjusted the songs and added narrative extracts from some of Trump's speech, that I have carefully chosen to show an actual goofy side of his personality. Graphically, I mainly used blue and red to reflect a patriotic vibe.

I did not create Just PresiDance to mock or denigrate Donald Trump, this is truly for a memetic purpose. I wish that the people who try this game understand the memes behind it and simply have fun playing with it.
